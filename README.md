# MURENA Bootable Linux Image (Buildroot)

This repository contains a Buildroot config extension. That means fully building the U-Boot image, Linux kernel, the rootfs image and the final partitioned binary image for flashing onto the bootable SD card.

Buildroot defconfig file: [configs/nuc970_murena_defconfig](configs/nuc970_murena_defconfig).

## Building the Image

download Buildroot and extract it into a folder.

```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch=2020.02.x https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot.git
```

Before building, install these Ubuntu packages:

```sh
sudo apt install swig python-dev fakeroot devscripts
```

If there are still error messages during later build, try installing these (sorry, did not clean up the list yet, some might be unnecessary):

```sh
sudo apt install -y chrpath gawk texinfo libsdl1.2-dev whiptail diffstat cpio libssl-dev
```

Then, create initial build configuration:

```sh
BR2_EXTERNAL=<path_to_this_repo> make nuc970_murena_defconfig
```

Customize Buildroot configuration if needed:

```sh
make menuconfig
```

Proceed with the build:

```sh
make
```

The build may take 1.5 hours on a decent machine, or longer. 

A successful build will produce a `output/images` folder. That folder contains all essential images (uImage, rootfs.tar, u-boot.bin, sdcard.img) that can now be written to the bootable SD card and to Murena Board SPI-Flash memory.

Use Nu Writer to write SPI-Flash. Make a bootble SDCard with dd command:
```sh
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M; sync
```
